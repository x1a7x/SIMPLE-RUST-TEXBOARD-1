this is https://github.com/x1a7x/SIMPLE-RUST-TEXBOARD (which uses sled db) converted to use postgres. 

Seems to work very well, not tested fully yet tho. Lightning fast even on tor because so far its only

rust and text. 

This is the early code to an imageboard that will be superior to existing ones. Feel free to correct me if im 
wrong, but i think https://usagi.reisen/ is the fastest well known ib that out there today (made in Golang) and this
aims to be far superior in speed and security. Feel free to make an issue and point out the very fastest well used imageboards.
(an untested app made for a single user does not count, it is not battle tested with multiple posters). This will end up being in the
top 3 most secure and fast imageboards of all.
